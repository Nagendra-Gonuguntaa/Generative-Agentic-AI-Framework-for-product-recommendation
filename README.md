# Generative-Agentic-AI-GA-AI-Framework-for-Product-Recommendation-
Implementation of a novel Generative  Agentic AI Framework for Product recommendation by integrating intent classification,  semantic retrieval, and natural language generation. 
Amazon 5 - core product review dataset has been used as the dataset. 
The dataset contained six categories: 
Toys and Games, Musical Instruments, Cell Phones and Accessories, Appliances, All Beauty, Amazon 
Fashion. 
The files was downloaded in the form of JSON. 5-core means that every user and every 
product has more than five reviews in the dataset. The dataset contained 3,199,522 reviews across six 
categories and it contained reviewer id, asin, review text, summary, overall rating as the features. This 
dataset is perfect for the current research as it provides rich, abundant reviews and 5-core filter 
guarantees a minimum strength per product.
Notebook 1 deals with EDA of the dataset and Data Modelling.
Notebook 2 deals with generating the embeddings and using FAISS index.
Notebook 3 deals with the implementation of Generative Agentic AI framework.
